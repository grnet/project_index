# project_index

## What is project_index?
Project index is a small attempt to gather all the information one needs in
order to find instances of a project, common tasks and anything involved in
his workflow.

### Projects
Projects can be added, along with their git repos, docs etc.

#### Dependencies
Project index will automatically discover `requirements.txt` file from your repository
(if there is access), else you can upload a requirements.txt file. But still it will try
to access your repo first.

### Notes
Notes can help one to avoid doing the same mistake twice.

### Tags
Tags are used in order to find topic related projects/notes.
